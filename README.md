## Description

In the past week, I embarked on the challenge of integrating a social network API, focusing solely on the backend aspect. Leveraging MongoDB along with the Mongoose ORM npm, I delved into crafting the backend logic. However, I found MongoDB to be a notably steeper learning curve compared to my experience with MySQL. Despite encountering hurdles along the way, such as consulting online resources and utilizing aids like the Xpert learning assistant and GPT-3.5, I managed to progress through approximately 90% of the challenge.

Through these trials, I've recognized the invaluable growth opportunities they present for my development skills. This journey underscored the reality that certain technologies demand more practice and concerted effort to master, necessitating seeking assistance from others as well. While the application is nearly complete, the functionality for adding and removing friends remains unfinished due to some minor bugs.

Nevertheless, I found the project immensely enjoyable and rewarding, further solidifying my passion for software development.
